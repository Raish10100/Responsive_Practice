# Responsive    

## CSS

### Flexbox
- x is main axis and y is cross axis.
- align-items: center; --> mean that the element will be centered vertically(y axis).
- justify-content: center; --> mean that the element will be centered horizontally (x axis). 
- In media-query we give max-width : 600px; --> it means that when screen width is less than 600px then apply this css.
